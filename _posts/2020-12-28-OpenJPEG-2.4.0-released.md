Good news everyone !

[OpenJPEG 2.4.0](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/releases/tag/v2.4.0) is released today.

This release brings several improvements on the encoder side:
* support for multithreading
* support for generation of PLT markers
* single-threaded performance improvements in forward DWT for 5-3 and 9-7 (and other improvements)
* support IMF profiles

as well as various bugfixes, as detailed in the Changelog hereunder.

The performance improvements and the generation of PLT markers have been implemented
thanks to funding from the European Space Agency (ESA), for operations of the
Mission Performance Centre (MPC) for the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission.

Enjoy,

Antonin
